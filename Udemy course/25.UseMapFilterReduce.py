# =========== REDUCE EXPLANATION ========================================
# Reduce is a really useful function for performing some computation
# on a list and returning the result. It applies a rolling computation
# to sequential pairs of values in a list. For example, if you wanted
# to compute the product of a list of integers.
# So the normal way you might go about doing this task in python is
# using a basic for loop:
product = 1
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for num in list:
    product = product * num
print(product)               # product = 24

# Now letâ€™s try it with reduce:
#from functools import reduce   # You must import reduce
product = reduce((lambda x, y: x * y), [1, 2, 3, 4])
print(product)   # Output: 24
