'''You are given two strings and you have to find an index of the second
occurrence of the second string in the first one. Let's go through the first
example where you need to find the second'
occurrence of "s" in a word "sims". Itâ€™s easy to find its first occurrence
with a function index or find which will point out that "s" is the first
symbol in a word "sims" and therefore the index of the first occurrence
is 0. But we have to find the second "s" which is 4th in a row and that means
that the index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.

Input: Two strings.
Output: Int or None
Example:
second_index("sims", "s") == 3
second_index("find the river", "e") == 12
second_index("hi", " ") is None  '''

text, symbol = "find the river", "e"


def second_index(text, symbol):
    if text.count(symbol) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        first_index = text.find(symbol)
    return text.find(symbol, first_index + 1)


print(second_index(text, symbol))
